## 🤔😅😂🤡💀🪦🗿

I do a bit of everything.

Art, music, programming, web development, app development, UI design, UX design, product design, copywriting, digital marketing, graphic design, game development, scientific research, 3D animation, video editing/content creation, writing articles, poetry, books, novels; creating shaders, social platforms, online experiences and new inventions that shake society more than my economic influence does..
